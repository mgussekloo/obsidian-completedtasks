# Completed Tasks

A free, simple and intuitive [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) plugin that automatically moves completed tasks (checked checkboxes) to the bottom of the list they're in. Inspired by ["Moving completed tasks to the end of the list"](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/2426).

## Features
![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgussekloo/obsidian-completedtasks/master/demo.gif)

- Tasks are reordered approx. every 10 seconds (if the document has changed).
- The plugin keeps the cursor on the appropriate line during sorting.
- The plugin is compatible with the popular [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin, but doesn't require it.
- The plugin reorders tasks at the root-level only. Any subtasks move with their parent.

## Usage

Install the plugin, that's it. Sorting happens automatically (every 10 seconds or so). There's a command to manually sort, but you don't need it.
