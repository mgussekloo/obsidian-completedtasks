# Completed Tasks

Simple plugin to sort / move completed tasks (checked checkboxes) to the bottom of the list.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgussekloo/obsidian-completedtasks/master/demo.gif)

Tasks are reordered every 10 seconds (only if the document has changed).<br />
The plugin tries to keep the cursor at the same line.<br />
The plugin is compatible with the popular [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin.<br />

Please feel free to contribute or request feautures.
