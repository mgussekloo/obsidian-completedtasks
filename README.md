# Completed Tasks

Simple plugin to sort / move completed tasks (checked checkboxes) to the bottom of the list.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgussekloo/obsidian-completedtasks/master/demo.gif)

Tasks are reordered every 10 seconds (only if the document has changed).
The plugin tries to keep the cursor at the same line.
