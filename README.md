# Completed Tasks

A free, simple and intuitive [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md) plugin that automatically moves completed tasks (checked checkboxes) to the bottom of the list they're in. Inspired by ["Moving completed tasks to the end of the list"](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/2426).

## Features
![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgussekloo/obsidian-completedtasks/master/demo.gif)

- Tasks are reordered every ... seconds, only if the document has changed (the interval is configurable).
- Keeps the cursor on the appropriate line during sorting.
- Compatible with the popular [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin but doesn't require it.
- Reorders tasks at the root-level, while subtasks move with their parent.
- Works in Reader mode.

## Usage

Install the plugin, that's it. Sorting happens automatically (every 10 seconds or so). There's a command to manually sort.

## Installation

[Get the plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=completed-tasks) from Community Plugins and install.

## Todo

- ~Add configuration options~
- Add feature that keeps a max number of completed tasks per list
